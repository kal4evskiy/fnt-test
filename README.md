This repo contains a very simple non-interactive Trello board that automatically updates while the web app is open. It is already functional, so you can focus only on the parts that you need to change.

## Goals of the task

1. Build a UI with 3 columns. Each column should have its own separate scroll.  
   Use CSS Grid if possible.
2. Render the name of each task instead of its ID. (See [query.Jobs.graphql](./src/modules/queries/query.Jobs.graphql))  
   Bonus: Truncate the name using CSS.

### Restrictions

- Do not use any additional UI or CSS libraries.
- Do not use any additional state management libraries.
- Try to adhere to the existing project structure if possible.

### What will we be paying attention to?

1. Coding style and consistency.  
   This project contains config for Prettier and ESLint. Be mindful of that.
2. CSS knowledge.
3. HTML semantics.
